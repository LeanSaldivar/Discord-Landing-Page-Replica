## Project Description

This project is a front-end recreation of the Discord landing page, built purely with **HTML** and **CSS**. The primary goal was to practice fundamental web development skills, focusing on semantic HTML structure and CSS styling techniques (including layout, responsiveness basics, etc.).

Currently, this is a **static visual clone** and does not include any JavaScript functionality or interactivity found on the original Discord website.

[Link to Original Discord Page](https://discord.com/) *(For reference)*

## Current Features

*   Semantic HTML structure mirroring the main sections of the Discord landing page (Navigation, Hero, Content Sections, Footer).
*   CSS styling to replicate the visual appearance (colors, fonts, spacing).
*   Basic layout implementation using [Flexbox]. *(For now)*

**Note:** As this version uses only HTML and CSS, features requiring JavaScript are **not** implemented. This includes:
*   Dropdown menus
*   Login/Open Discord button functionality
*   Dynamic content loading
*   Form submissions
*   Interactive animations or effects

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and visual presentation.
*   **IDE:** [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) was used as the primary development environment.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for web projects:
```bash
├── index.html # Main HTML file
├── css/ # Stylesheets
│    └── style.css # Main CSS file
├── res/ # Static resources (assets)
│    ├── fonts/ # Local font files (.woff, .woff2, etc.)
│    ├── img/ # Images (svg, png, jpg, gif, webp)
│    └── media/ # Media files (mp4, m4a)
├── README.md # This file
```
*   **Asset Acquisition:** Assets like specific fonts and images were obtained by inspecting the official Discord website using browser developer tools (Network tab) for learning and replication purposes. All assets are used strictly for this non-commercial, educational project.

## Getting Started

To view the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your GitHub Username]/[Your Repository Name].git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [Your Repository Name]
    ```
3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Alternatively, if using WebStorm, you can often run it directly from the IDE (e.g., by right-clicking `index.html` and selecting "Open in Browser").

No build steps or dependencies are required for this static version.

## Future Plans

This project serves as a foundation. The next phase involves incorporating **JavaScript** to add interactivity and dynamic features, aiming to more closely replicate the user experience of the actual Discord landing page. Planned updates include:

*   Implementing interactive navigation menus (e.g., dropdowns).
*   Adding functionality to buttons (even if simulated initially).
*   Exploring JavaScript-driven animations or effects.
*   Refining responsiveness across a wider range of devices.

This project will be updated as my JavaScript skills develop.

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal learning project. However, suggestions or feedback are welcome! Feel free to open an issue if you spot any bugs or have ideas for improvement, especially regarding the planned JavaScript implementation.
